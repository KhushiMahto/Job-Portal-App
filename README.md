# JOB PORTAL APP
Job Portal is a full-stack web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), designed to streamline the job search and hiring process for both students and recruiters.

The platform supports two user roles — Students and Recruiters — each with tailored functionalities:

1.🧑‍🎓 Students can sign up, browse job listings, filter jobs based on location, industry, and salary, apply for jobs, and track their application status directly from their profile dashboard.

2.🧑‍💼 Recruiters can sign up, register their company, post job openings, and manage applicants by accepting or rejecting job applications in real-time.

The application includes a responsive landing page, secure login/signup system, and a fully dynamic UI for a seamless experience across user types.
